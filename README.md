# Exploring Weather Trends - Project Instructions

### Summary

You will examine local and worldwide temperature data and compare temperature patterns where you live to global temperature trends in this assignment.

### Instructions

    Your task will be to construct a graphic and write a report outlining the similarities and contrasts between
    worldwide temperature trends and temperature trends in the nearest large city to your home.
    To accomplish this, follow the instructions below:

    - Take the data from the database and extract it. In the following section, there is a database-connected workspace.
      You'll need to export temperature data for the entire planet as well as the nearest large city to your home.
      In the city list table, you'll find a list of cities and nations.
      You'll need to construct a SQL query to communicate with the database.
    - Create a SQL query to extract data at the city level. Export to a CSV file.
    - To extract the global data, write a SQL query. Export to a CSV file.
    
- **Open the CSV** in whichever program you're most familiar with. We recommend Excel or Google Sheets, but you are free to use whatever program you choose, including Python or R.
- **Create a line graph** that compares the temperatures in your city to the world temperatures. Make careful you plot the _moving average_ instead of the yearly averages to       smooth out the lines and make patterns easier to spot (the last concept in the previous lesson goes over how to do this in a spreadsheet).
- **Observe** the parallels and contrasts between world averages and averages in your city, as well as overall trends.  To get you started, here are some questions.
    - Is your city hotter or colder on average than the rest of the world? Has there been a constant difference over time?
    - “How do temperature variations in your city compare to worldwide average temperature changes throughout time?”
    - How does the overall trend appear? Is it growing hotter or colder in the world? Has the pattern been consistent throughout the previous few centuries?
